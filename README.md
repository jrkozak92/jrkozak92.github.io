# Installation
Installation is as simple as downloading the index.html file and assets folder and colocating them in a folder somewhere. Open the index.html file with a web browser to see it in all its glory.

Alternatively, you can see it hosted on GitHub Pages with my custom domain [here](http://www.joeykozak.com).

# Purpose
This project's core functionality is to serve as a GitHub Pages hosted landing page to my personal portfolio website, but conveniently also serves as an example of some simple web design skills, including HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, and responsive design. 
It also is a conventient place to link to my site-manager application, which is in development to serve as an example of full stack development skills and manage the non-GitHub based presentation of my future projects in an easy to digest portfolio format.

# Development
Development was pretty straight forward here, just standard HTML and CSS. The biggest challenge was my lack of exposure to GitHub and its workflows, but it was a solid, simple, first exposure to how it works, and makes it easy to link to projects hosted in other repos.
